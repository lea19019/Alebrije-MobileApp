# Alebrije-MobileApp

This mobile app was created with the intention to continue my journey in Android development.
I used Android Studio to develop this app, and it was the first occasion I used it. It was also meant to be a practice
to help get deeper in my Kotlin learning. 

Alebrije Mobile App is an interactive app that will allow you create an Alebrije!
Fascinating imaginary creatures, you will find a description at the beginning of the app, you will have
several prompts you have to answer to create your first Alerije!
Feel free to download the code and have fun playing.
